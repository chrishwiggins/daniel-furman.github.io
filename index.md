##### I am curious about the applications of machine learning across a diverse range of scientific, social, and economic data.<br><br>

### Ensemble Climate Projections
---
* Optimized and compared geospatial machine learning models, directed programming within a five-person team 
* Built architecture for ETL data pipelines, processed hundreds of gigabytes of shapefile and raster data
*	Created and presented a 10-minute talk at the 2019 SCURR professional research conference

### Material Science of Ice Densification
---
*	Developed and led a three-year experimental project, awarded 2020 Rose Undergraduate Research Award
*	Investigated the microphysics of ice compaction within geologic settings, detailed in a senior thesis 
*	Drafted a material physics focused manuscript exploring our discoveries, awaiting future journal publication
